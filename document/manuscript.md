# Introduction {-}

Add an introduction of the Open Science. To cite an article, use \cite{Schlegel2016}. All the bibliographies should be added to `library.bib` in the BibTeX format. See the example in `library.bib`. 

Since this will more or less be like a review article, we will need to identify the various subsections based on the topics we need to cover in the review. See [this article](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619) for some tips \cite{Mensh2017}.


## Status of Open Science in Kenya: Literature search {-}

The report from the above team will be useful for writing the introduction, as well as providing materials to be used in the discussion. In fact, we can use their resource to weave the whole paper together.

In this section, and the introduction, we will conduct a review of the status of open science in the country. 
- What kind of resources are available to support open science
- Are there policies or incentives for open science practices?
- What kind of training activities have been conducted to promote and train students and researchers on open science tools and practices?
- etc


# DataMining Section {-}

This will be a data analysis section. The title of this section will depend on the results of your analysis. For example, if Kenyan researchers are not publishing open access, we will need to understand why that is the case. The solution may lie in the cost of publishing, and that is how the resource created by Open Access options team is useful. 

We address questions like:
- What is the publishing trend by Kenyan researchers
- Are they publishing open access, and how has this changed over the years?
- Are Kenyan researchers embracing pre-prints (BioRXiv, AriRXiv, ResearchGate). Who is driving the adoption of pre-prints? Local researchers or foreign collaborators?
- What are the collaboration trends? Are Kenyan researcher collaborating locally or internationally? 

# But Publishing Open Access is Expensive {-}

This remains the main barrier to publishing open access, in addition to the obsession with impact factors. However, for early career scientists and students, especially in developing countries, most publishers offer waivers and subsidies. In this section, we explore some of the avenues to publishing open access at low cost. 

To address this problem, we created a resource that can guide ECR and students on where they publish open access, and at low cost. We also provide information on how they can still be open, eg via the green route. 



# Figures {-}

You can add the figures as follows:
