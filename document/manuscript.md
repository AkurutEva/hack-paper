# Introduction {-}

Add an introduction of the Open Science. To cite an article, use \cite{Schlegel2016}. All the bibliographies should be added to `library.bib` in the BibTeX format. See the example in `library.bib`. 

Since this will more or less be like a review article, we will need to identify the various subsections based on the topics we need to cover in the review. See [this article](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619) for some tips \cite{Mensh2017}.


## Status of Open Science in Kenya: Literature search {-}

The report from the above team will be useful for writing the introduction, as well as providing materials to be used in the discussion. In fact, we can use their resource to weave the whole paper together.


# DataMining Section {-}

This will be a data analysis section. The title of this section will depend on the results of your analysis. For example, if Kenyan researchers are not publishing open access, we will need to understand why that is the case. The solution may lie in the cost of publishing, and that is how the resource created by Open Access options team is useful. 


# But Publishing Open Access is Expensive {-}

This remains the main barrier to publishing open access, in addition to the obsession with impact factors. However, for early career scientists and students, especially in developing countries, most publishers offer waivers and subsidies. In this section, we explore some of the avenues to publishing open access at low cost. 



# Figures {-}

You can add the figures as follows:

And you can have it referenced as a figure
